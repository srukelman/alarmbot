# Alarmbot  
the idea behind alarmbot is that it is a more *advanced* and more *effective* alarm clock  
it is too easy to shut off a normal alarm clock and accidentally fall back asleep  
the solution? **alarmbot**  
what if you had to chase your alarm clock around your house to turn it off?  
it would pretty hard to accidentally fall back asleep after that

we will make a 4-wheel omni-directional robot (allowing for more precise control than a car/tank setup)  
we will then mount a rasperberrypi which will control the alarm as well as have cameras and LIDAR mounted  
the LIDAR will be used to perform SLAM(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) so the robot understands where it is in a room/where it can go  
the cameras will monitor the person to drive in the opposite direction to make capture as difficult as possible
